# Roadside_Assistance_App

This application was created to help people who require roadside assistance in remote areas.
In places where a company service centre is not available, OnRoad lets you find technical assistance from nearby service mechanics and technicians. 

This is an `Android` app and also made for `web`. This app was tested on **Android Oreo (8.1)** and **Chrome v114.0**.
# Key Features
The users can look up the nearest technicians that have registered on the app.
The technicians can approve or deny a request made by the user ( similar to drivers' requests in cab services).

# Finding the nearest mechanic
Users can choose, request, or even call the technicians in the search results.
